# Quicksort Time Complexity Visualization

This project demonstrates the time complexity of the Quicksort algorithm by sorting arrays of various sizes and measuring the time taken. The results are visualized using a line chart created with JFreeChart.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the repository:*

    sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quicksort-time-complexity.git
    cd quicksort-time-complexity
    

2. *Download JFreeChart library:*
   
   Download the following JAR files and place them in the lib directory:
   - [JFreeChart](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jfree/jfreechart/1.5.3/jfreechart-1.5.3.jar)
   - [JCommon](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jfree/jcommon/1.0.24/jcommon-1.0.24.jar)

3. *Compile the project:*

    sh
    javac -cp lib/jfreechart-1.5.3.jar:lib/jcommon-1.0.24.jar -d . src/QuickSortTimeComplexity.java
    

    (Note: Use ; instead of : for the classpath separator on Windows)

4. *Run the application:*

    sh
    java -cp .:lib/jfreechart-1.5.3.jar:lib/jcommon-1.0.24.jar QuickSortTimeComplexity
    

    (Note: Use ; instead of : for the classpath separator on Windows)

## Project Structure

- src/QuickSortTimeComplexity.java: Contains the main logic for the Quicksort algorithm, measuring execution time, and generating the time complexity graph.
- lib/: Contains the JFreeChart and JCommon library JAR files.
- README.md: Instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following main dependency:

- JFreeChart: For creating and displaying the time complexity graph.

## Example Output

The program sorts arrays of various sizes, measures the time taken for each, and displays a line chart showing the relationship between array size and time taken to sort.
